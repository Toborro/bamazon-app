# Bamazon-app

Bamazon is a much smaller version of the Amazon storefront. Without all the cool looks either. Bamazon is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data. 

Commands:

* node bamazonCustomer.js: runs the program and allows you to select the ID of the item you wish to buy, along with how many.
